# University Student Analytics (Java) ☕

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It manages student data and performs basic statistical calculations, simulating a real-world data processing scenario.

## OOP Principles Applied
- **Encapsulation:** Using private fields and public getters to protect data integrity.
- **Collections Framework:** Utilizing `ArrayList` for dynamic data management.
- **Clean Code:** Focused on readability and clear class structure.

## How to Run
1. Compile the files:
   javac Main.java Student.java

2. Run the application:
   java Main
